## **About Java**

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence, robustness, and security. It follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle, making it highly portable. Java is widely used for web applications, enterprise software, mobile applications, and backend development due to its strong memory management and multithreading capabilities.
