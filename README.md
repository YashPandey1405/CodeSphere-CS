# CodeSphere-CS

Welcome to the **CodeSphere-CS** repository! This collection houses coding solutions, assignments, and projects completed during my BTech program.
The repository includes a variety of concepts and languages, with a primary focus on problem-solving and algorithmic approaches. 
The solutions are written in Java, JavaScript, Python, and other relevant programming languages based on the course requirements.

## Key Features:
- **Semester-wise Organization:** Each folder corresponds to a specific semester, making it easy to navigate through the respective coursework.
- **Detailed Code Comments:** Each solution includes clear comments and explanations to ensure the logic and flow are easily understandable.
- **Code Efficiency:** Solutions are optimized for performance, adhering to best practices for time and space complexity.
- **Conceptual Clarity:** Projects and assignments demonstrate a strong understanding of key computer science concepts such as data structures, algorithms, OOP, and system design.

## Contribution:
Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest improvements. This repository is an ongoing work-in-progress, and I aim to keep adding new solutions as I progress through my coursework.
